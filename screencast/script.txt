***alice starts conversation with cheshire cat***
[alice] would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?
[cheshire_cat] that depends a good deal on where you want to get to
[alice] I don't much care where
[cheshire_cat] then it doesn't matter which way you go
[alice] ...so long as I get *somewhere*
[cheshire_cat] oh, you're sure to do that
[cheshire_cat] if you only walk long enough :D

[alice] there's plenty of room!
[mad_hatter] why is a raven like a writing desk?
[alice] I believe I can guess that
[mad_hatter] /invite white_rabbit
[white_rabbit] /me takes a watch out of his waistcoat pocket
[white_rabbit] I'm late, I'm late, for a very important date
[white_rabbit] /leave
[march_hare] do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?
[alice] exactly so
[march hare] then you should say what you mean

[alice] /leave
