				<h3>Data Collected</h3>
				<p>
					We collect anonymous data from every visitor of the Website to monitor traffic and fix bugs. For example, we collect information like web requests, the data sent in response to such requests, the Internet Protocol address, the browser type, the browser language, and a timestamp for the request.
				</p>
				<p>
					We ask you to log in and provide certain personal information (such as your name and email address) in order to be able to save your profile and the documents and comments associated with it.  In order to enable these or any other login based features, we use cookies to store session information for your convenience. You can block or delete cookies and still be able to use Vine, although if you do you will then be asked for your username and password every time you log in to the Website. In order to take advantage of certain features of the Website, you may also choose to provide us with other personal information, such as your picture or personal website, but your decision to utilize these features and provide such data will always be voluntary.
				</p>
				<p>
					 You are able to view, change and remove your data associated with your profile. Should you choose to delete your account, please contact us at support@Vine.zendesk.com and we will follow up with such request as soon as possible. You can also modify your notification preferences by clicking the appropriate link included in the footer of email notifications.

				<h3>Use of the Data</h3>
				<p>
					We only use your personal information to provide you the Vine services or to communicate with you about the services or the Website.
				</p>
				<p>
					With respect to any documents you may choose to upload to Vine, , we take the privacy and confidentiality of such documents seriously. We encrypt all documents, and permanently delete any redacted edits you make to documents. If you choose to make a document public, we recommend you redact any and all references to people and addresses, as we can't protect public data and we are not responsible for any violation of privacy law you may be liable for.
				</p>
				<p>
					We employ industry standard techniques to protect against unauthorized access of data about you that we store, including personal information. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We do not share personal information you have provided to us without your consent, unless:
				</p>
				<p>
					doing so is appropriate to carry out a user’s request;
					we believe it's needed to enforce our Terms of Service, or that is legally required;
					we believe it's needed to detect, prevent or address fraud, security or technical issues;
					otherwise protect our property, legal rights, or that of others.
					Vine is operated from the United States.  If you are visiting the Website from outside the U.S., you agree to any processing of any personal information you provide us according to this policy.
				</P>
				<p>
					Vine may contact you, by email or other means. For example, Vine may send you promotional emails relating to Vine or other third parties Vine feels you would be interested in, or communicate with you about your use of the Vine website. Vine may also use technology to alert us via a confirmation email when you open an email from us. If you do not want to receive email from Vine, please opt out of receiving emails at the bottom of any Vine emails or by editing you profile preferences.
